# Solid Organ Transplants and Sepsis

This repository contains code and synthetic data to recreate the analyses in Ackerman et al.'s *Effect of Sepsis on Death as Modified by Solid Organ Transplantation* (2022). We hope this repository will help other analysts intending to run a similar analysis.

The analysis was run in `R` using the open-source, `sl3` compatible version of [`lmtp`](https://github.com/nt-williams/lmtp).
